# ESP-touchplate

This is a small low cost device I created that you can plug a Wemos D1 mini into.  There are 2 buttons using TTP223 boards and an LCD to display status (0.96 OLED)

I have the .STL file to 3D print an enclosure that fits in a decora switch plate cover.

ESPHome example YAML is included but I do plan to create MQTT control via arduibo sketch in the near future.
